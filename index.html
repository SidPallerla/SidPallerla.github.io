                <ul class="text-lg">
                    <p class="text-lg"> Throughout my academic journey, I've delved into diverse realms of computer science and mathematics. Beginning with CS61A, an introductory coding class, I gained foundational knowledge in object-oriented programming and even delved into creating a Scheme interpreter. Moving forward, in CS61B, a data structures course, I undertook projects involving the implementation of a web server and a word file parser. Over summers, I immersed myself in mathematical studies, tackling courses like Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, while simultaneously honing my programming skills by developing a Python Reddit bot to interface with APIs and libraries. Further enriching my understanding, I engaged in a Discrete Math and Probability course, where I explored Graph Theory and Probability Theory, while also serving as an academic teaching assistant for data structures. Presently, I'm engaged in advanced research work and taking an intensive algorithmic class, delving into concepts like Dynamic Programming and NP Completeness. In parallel, I'm expanding my technical repertoire by mastering frameworks, languages, and software tools such as Linux, Docker, HTML, CSS, and AWS.</p>
