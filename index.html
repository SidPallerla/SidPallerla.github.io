                <ul class="text-lg">
                    <li>First semester: CS61A, an introduction coding class, where I learned object oriented programming as well as how to create a Scheme interpreter.</li>
                    <li>Second semester: Took CS61B, a data structures class, where I developed a project that implemented a web server and word file parser.</li>
                    <li>Summer after second semester: I took multiple math classes such as Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus. I also created a Python Reddit bot to get some practice in using API's and libraries.</li>
                    <li>Third semester: Discrete Math and Probability course, in which, I learned various topics such as Graph theory and Probability theory. I also worked as an academic teaching assistant during this time.</li>
                    <li>Current semester: I started working on a research team and I am taking an advanced algorithm class in which I have been learning about concepts such as Dynamic Programming and NP Completeness. Parallely, I have been learning various frameworks, languages, and softwares such as Linux, Docker, HTML, CSS, and AWS</li>
